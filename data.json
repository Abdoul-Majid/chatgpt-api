It was created by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems (now owned by Oracle) and was released in 1995.\n\nSome key features and advantages of Java include its platform independence, object-oriented nature, robust community support, and vast collection of libraries and frameworks. Java applications can run on any operating system that has a Java Virtual Machine (JVM), making it highly portable.\n\nTo start programming in Java, you need to install the Java Development Kit (JDK), which includes the necessary tools such as the Java compiler (javac) and the Java runtime environment (JRE). You can write Java code in a text editor and then compile and run it using command-line tools, or you can use an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) such as Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, or NetBeans, which provide a more user-friendly and feature-rich development environment.\n\nJava follows object-oriented programming principles and uses classes and objects to represent entities and their behavior. It supports various other concepts such as inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation. The language has a rich set of pre-built classes and libraries, called the Java Standard Library, which provides many useful functionalities.\n\nJava also has a strong and active community, with a huge number of resources available online, including documentation, tutorials, forums, and open-source projects. This makes it easy to learn Java and get help when needed.\n\nOverall, Java is a versatile and reliable programming language suitable for a wide range of applications, from simple command-line tools to complex enterprise systems."}
